# Using Spring Initializr

## Introduction
Spring Initializr is a web-based tool that allows you to bootstrap a Spring Boot application quickly.

## Getting Started
1. **Navigate** to [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) website.
2. **Select** project metadata:
   - Choose your preferred language (e.g., Java, Kotlin).
   - Set the Spring Boot version.
   - Specify project metadata such as Group, Artifact, and dependencies.
3. **Click** on the "Generate" button to download the project archive.

## Using Spring Initializr
1. **Extract** the downloaded archive to your desired location.
2. **Import** the project into your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. **Start coding!** Add your application logic and modify the project structure as needed.

## Running the Application
1. **Build** the project using Maven or Gradle.
2. **Run** the application using the provided Maven/Gradle tasks or directly from your IDE.

## Additional Notes
- If you encounter any issues, refer to the Spring Boot documentation or community forums for assistance.
- Feel free to customize the project dependencies and metadata to suit your application requirements.

## Example
Here's a brief example demonstrating the creation of a simple Spring Boot application using Spring Initializr:

1. Go to [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/).
2. Select "Java" as the language, "2.6.0" as the Spring Boot version.
3. Set Group to "com.example" and Artifact to "demo".
4. Add dependencies: "Spring Web".
5. Click on "Generate" to download the project.
6. Extract the downloaded archive and import the project into your IDE.
7. Add your application logic to `DemoApplication.java`.
8. Build and run the application.

## Running the Provided Spring Boot Application with XML Bean Configuration : dependencyInjection file
1. **Clone** or **download** the provided Spring Boot project with XML bean configuration.
2. **Navigate** to the project directory.
3. **Open** the project in your favorite IDE.
4. **Create** a package named `com.dhyanesh.first` if it doesn't exist already.
5. **Copy** and **paste** the provided `Student.java` class into this package.
6. **Create** a folder named `resources` in the `src/main` directory if it doesn't exist already.
7. **Create** a file named `beans.xml` inside the `resources` folder.
8. **Copy** and **paste** the provided XML bean configuration into `beans.xml`.
9. **Open** the `DependencyInjectionApplication.java` class.
10. **Uncomment** the line `SpringApplication.run(DependencyInjectionApplication.class, args);`.
11. **Save** the file.
12. **Build** the project using Maven or Gradle.
13. **Run** the `DependencyInjectionApplication` class as a Java application.
14. **Observe** the output in the console, which should display the student's name and roll number based on the bean configuration.
