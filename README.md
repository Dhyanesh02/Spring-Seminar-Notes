   - Set the Spring Boot version.
   - Specify project metadata such as Group, Artifact, and dependencies.
3. **Click** on the "Generate" button to download the project archive.

## Using Spring Initializr
1. **Extract** the downloaded archive to your desired location.
2. **Import** the project into your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. **Start coding!** Add your application logic and modify the project structure as needed.

## Running the Application
1. **Build** the project using Maven or Gradle.
2. **Run** the application using the provided Maven/Gradle tasks or directly from your IDE.

## Additional Notes
- If you encounter any issues, refer to the Spring Boot documentation or community forums for assistance.
- Feel free to customize the project dependencies and metadata to suit your application requirements.
